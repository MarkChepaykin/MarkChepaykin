Welcome to my GitHub!

My journey began in late 2020 when I discovered my passion for C# and .NET while working on a game project with a friend in Unity. Since then, I have been actively learning and exploring various programming concepts to enhance my skills.

Recently, I took a big step forward in my career and enrolled in a software development course at the "TOP Academy". I am excited to systemize my knowledge and hone my coding abilities to become a skilled professional in the field of software development.

My ultimate goal is to work on some exciting projects and create digital products that bring value to people's lives. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I hope you find my work interesting and inspiring!
